# World of Darkness Rules

# THE ATOMIC UNIT OF ACTION:

Roll one d10 (ten sided die) for each dot in a trait or combination of traits
then compare the numbers with the difficulty of the action. All dice that exceed
that number are "successes". Each result of 1 reduces the number of successes by
one.

# ROLLING DICE

|DIE ROLL| STANDARD VALUE
|---|------
|1| -1 to successes, potential botch
|2-5| failure
|6-9| 1 success
|10| success + 1 extra roll (with specialty<sup>DW</sup>) 

- 1 is always a failure and a reduction of total successes
- 10 is always a success

>DW: for characters and bosses - always extra roll, 1s on this roll do not count
against total successes

|DICE ROLLED     |CHANCE OF SUCCESS
-----------------|-----------------------------------
|X               |Abysmal/No Chance
|1               |Poor/Miniscule Chance
|2               |Average/Middling Chance
|3               |Good/Decent Chance
|4               |Exceptional/Good Chance
|5               |Superb/Rather Good Chance
|6               |Legendary/ Really Good Chance

|DIFFICULTY      |EXAMPLE
|----------------|-----------
|3               |Trivial (hopping a creek)
|4               |Easy (cooking a meal)
|5               |Straightforward (changing the oil in your car)
|6               |Standard (punching someone in the face)
|7               |Challenging (comprehending a book by Crowley)
|8               |Difficult (playing all of '2112' on your guitar)
|9               |Extreme (sealing a million dollar deal with reluctant folks)

| TOTAL SUCCESS DIE | DEGREE OF SUCCESS
-----------------|-----
|0               | Failure
|1               |Marginal (getting a stranger to flirt with you)
|2               |Moderate (getting a stranger to give you their number)
|3               |Complete (getting a stranger to agree to a date)
|4               |Exceptional (getting a stranger to go on a date immediately)
|5 or more       |Phenomenal (going home with a stranger)


###  MODIFIERS

- difficulty may be decreased or increased by up to 3 based on especially
favorable or unfavorable circumstances.

- dice may also be added or taken away from the pool for especially favorable or
unfavorable internal circumstances

### THRESHOLDS

A task may be so difficult as to require multiple successes. Instead of rolling
against an increased difficulty (as opposed to the default of 6) you add a die
for each diff beyond the default. For example, a diff 10 roll could also be
expressed as a diff 9 roll that requires 2 successes rather than just 1 to
succeed at all.

For every level of a threshold, that threshold removes one success rolled. A
threshold of one success removes one success. A threshold of two removes two
successes, etc. By default, an action has a threshold of 0. A total of 5
successes on such an action would count as 5 successes. By comparison, if an
action had a threshold of 3, a total of 5 successes would count as 2 successes.

A threshold rule can also be used to reflect a relatively easy task that
requires a lot of work ie. difficulty 3, 15 successes is an easy but involved
task (such as doing the dishes). You could accumulate the successes over
multiple turns.

Threshold die removal occurs ***before*** successes are taken away by 1s for the
purposes of determining botches.


### ACTION TYPES

##### SIMPLE ACTION
A straightforward task that requires a single success and takes a single turn

##### REFLEXIVE ACTION
An action that takes no real time or deliberate effort to perform. It is
essentially instant and automatic, like seeing a mountain that is directly in
front of you as opposed to solving Where's Waldo. It usually does not require a
roll with the most common exception being soak rolls.

##### MULTIPLE ACTIONS
To perform several actions in a single turn first figure out the dice pools you
would normally use for those actions, then use the lowest dice pool among
them. You can then divide the dice in that pool however you like between the two
actions.

**Ex:** You would like to sing an opera while riding a horse. You would normally
have a die pool of 6 for singing an opera and 4 for riding a horse. You
therefore have 4 dice to work with. You can then divide those 4 dice however you
like between the two actions... 2 and 2, 3 and 1, or 1 and 3.

##### EXTENDED ACTIONS
As mentioned in thresholds, you can require a certain number of successes for a
task and accumulate those successes over multiple rolls spread out over multiple
periods of time. In a relaxed situation, any number of rolls can be done and
each one required just adds to the time needed. Where time is pressing, there
can be a limited number of rolls the character is allowed to try and accumulate
the successes needed to meet the threshold.

##### FAILING OR BOTCHING EXTENDED ACTIONS
A failure represents a failed roll. A botch generally represents a complete and
irrecoverable loss of progress. (using willpower is generally a good idea for
difficult or important extended rolls)

##### COMPLEMENTARY ROLLS (OPTIONAL)
A player can make a roll with one task to assist the performance of another. A
successful complementary roll reduces the difficulty of the other roll by 1 for
each success past the first, maximum -3. 

**Ex:** Bob is trying to perform a task with a difficulty of 9. Sue assists him
with a complementary roll and gets 2 successes. That reduces the difficulty for
Bob down to 7.

Later on, Bob needs more help on a different task that has a difficulty of
8. Sue comes to his aid again, getting 5 successes on her complementary
roll. This would reduce the difficulty for Bob down to 3 if it weren't for the
-3 cap. Because of that, his difficulty is reduced down to 5.

##### RESISTED ACTIONS
When a character takes an action that is resisted by another character, they
both roll. The resister's successes subtract from the successes of the character
making an attempt. 

EX. Sneaky is trying to get past Guardy. Sneaky rolls dexterity + stealth vs
Guardy's perception + alertness. If Sneaky gets 3 successes and Guardy gets 2,
Sneaky gets 1 total success and wins. If they both get 3, Sneaky's successes are
reduced to 0 and the action fails. The subtraction happens after botch determination.

The difficulty is generally 6 but if the task is easier or harder for one of the
parties, the difficulties are adjusted accordingly. (higher difficulty to spot
someone at night or lower difficulty to be unheard in a loud room, etc.) 

##### EXTENDED AND RESISTED ACTIONS
Two characters engaged in an sustained and limited contest (a race, chess game,
wrestling match, etc). The initiating character must accumulate a certain number
of successes and the opposing player must reduce those successes.<sup>DW</sup>


>DW: positive and negative success thresholds can be used ie. at +5 successes, white wins the chess game, -5 successes, black wins

## ACTION SUMMARIES
|   Action             | Description        | Example
|----------------------|--------------------|-
|Reflexive             | No Roll            | spending willpower, soak, saying a word
|Simple                | one roll, success needed | throwing a punch, looking for something, impressing someone
|Multiple              | split lowest dice pool between all | pulling out a wrench and hitting someone with it, driving and shooting
|Extended              | several rolls with a success threshold | fixing a computer, conducting a ritual
|Resisted              | opposing players roll against each other | grabbing an angry cat, impressing a potential client|
| Both Extended and Resisted | several opposed rolls | bathing angry cat, arguing online

#### TEAMWORK
Characters working together (mostly on extended actions) can combine their total
successes in order to meet a threshold. The success totals for each individual
are calculated, then pooled together. A botch by any individual generally ruins
the whole attempt.

#### FAILURE
0 total successes means the action failed, period. 

#### TRYING AGAIN
When trying a failed action again, generally add +1 to the difficulty for each
previous failure if the failure has any impact on future tries (social
interactions, frustration, time pressure, etc). This is not applied if the
player attempts a different tactic or approach to tackling the challenge. (ex
incorporating a mistake in a musical performance into an improvisational
flourish)

#### BOTCH
A botch is a catastrophic failure with game-altering repercussions. A roll of a
1 takes away the highest value success you've gotten on a roll. If you have more
1s than successes, you've botched. Like extra successes, extra 1s increase the
severity. A single botch may be an embarrassment or give a significant advantage
to an opponent. A triple botch may be fatal.

#### BOTCHES AND THRESHOLDS
A player may want to take their time with an especially difficult task, trading
in a high difficulty for an extended roll with a success threshold. This
trade-off greatly reduces the odds of a catastrophic failure.

### NON-ROLL SUCCESSES

#### AUTOMATIC SUCCESS
Use this for trivial tasks where a single success is all that's necessary and
there is no resistance

#### SPENDING WILLPOWER
A character may spend one point of willpower per turn to gain an automatic
success. Spending willpower in this way guarantees at least one success on a
roll that cannot be canceled out by a one. Cancel out all other success dice
before this is factored in.




# Action Turns
##### INITIATIVE
Each character rolls initiative (one d10 + dex + wit). Characters then
act highest to lowest. In the case of a tie, the character with the
highest 'initiative rating' (dex + wit). If that's tied, favor the
character with the highest wit. If that's tied, favor the character with
the highest dex. (Optionally rolled once at the start of a sequence or
once per turn)

>DW: ties vs baddies go to players except in the case of bosses. Bosses
win ties.

#### ACTION
Characters choose what they're going to do

#### RESOLUTION
The chosen actions resolve. Roll the dice.

>oWoD: Characters declare their actions lowest initiative to highest initiative, then
actions resolve highest to lowest

## MOVEMENT

#### MOVEMENT RATES
|       Movement   |    Distance Per Turn
---|---
|       Walk   |    7 yards
|       Jog    |    12 + Dexterity Yards
|       Run    |    20 + (3 * Dexterity) Yards
|       Swim   |    8 + dex (unskilled) or 12 + dex (skilled) yards
|       Fly    |    10 to 20 yards
|       Climb  |    10 feet(3.3 yards) per success normally; 15-20 under ideal conditions; 5 feet per success under poor conditions

- **Moving and Acting** A character can move half of their normal running speed
in a single turn and still act without taking a penalty. Beyond that, they
have to reduce their die pool for that second action by one for every yard
moved.

- **Stamina** A character can move at full speed for roughly 10 turns for every
point of stamina they possess.

- **Stamina and Adverse Conditions** High intensity movement (jumping, swimming,
sprinting) can cut the normal amount of time they can sustain a movement by
half. It can be further cut due to extreme circumstances (swimming through
heavy waves, dodging gunfire, outrunning a bear). To push beyond limits, the
character may roll Stamina or Willpower (whichever is greater). A botch on
this roll and the character trips, their body gives out, or some other
movement stopping effect. 

- **Health Penalty** Characters who have reached the injured Health Level or lower
move at half their normal rate.

#### Notes
1.  Typically 6 but may go up or down depending on circumstances
1.  Int can replace Per, to reflect cunning
1.  Watcher's per + awareness; could also be set by conditions - higher for light
   or open space, lower for darkness or cover
1.  Craft reflects the appropriate Trait; it could also be Art or Knowledge
1.  Or a knowledge trait related to the game. Could also be man + intimidation
   (to bluff); per + intuition (to read opponent); or int + enigmas (to work
   out puzzle).
1.  Depends upon system being hacked; for details see extended computer rules in 
   The Book of Secrets
1.  Man could be replaced by dex, sta, cha, or app, depending on the type of
   performance. Expression, intimidation, or seduction could be used to
   compensate for lack of skill
1.  Research can be replaced by streetwise (for dirt), etiquette (high society),
   computer (for computer searches), or other appropriate knowledge traits
   (esoterica, government, investigation, etc)
1.  Depends on how accessible the information is: 4 = widely available, 6 =
   normally accessible, 8 = hard to find, 9 + threshold = secret, classified,
   or assumed lost
1. Knowledge reflects the trait necessary to encode or decode the
   information. Typically code traits include Esoterica (appropriate
   specialty), linguistics (appropriate language), science (appropriate
   discipline), or other fields. To crack a code without the appropriate
   information, you might use computer(to access databases) at a +3 diff and
   twice the normal successes needed; cracking the code when you do have the
   information speeds the process considerably. Creating or cracking complex
   codes is an extended activity, with each roll reflecting one day, week, or
   month, depending on the code's complexity. Many modern ciphers cannot be
   decoded without computers, and take days or weeks to unravel even then.
1. Any social trait works; Cha reflects force of personality, man is obvious,
   and appearance lets you use beauty to your advantage.
1. Difficulty is observer's wit + subterfuge.
1. Torturer makes one roll per turn. Each scene of mental torture costs the
   victim one point of temporary willpower.
   Each scene of physical torture cost the victim one health level of bashing
   or lethal damage depending on method; intense torment inflicts two health
   levels per scene). Intense or lethal torture reduces tormentor's difficulty
   by -2. Botched roll gets false information, breaks target's mind, or
   possibly kills target.
1. Difficulties depend upon travel conditions, from 3 or 4 in calm conditions
   to 9 + threshold under hazardous conditions.
1. Target may use dex + stealth on foot(wit + stealth to duck behind
   cover). Pursuer's roll is resisted with per + subterfuge, and the pursuers must
   win roll in order to find target.
1. Pursuer tries to equal or exceed target's successes; target tries to evade
   pursuer. Target begins with a head start between one and four successes. (One
   success = 2 yards on foot, 10 yards in cars, 50 yards in large
   vehicles). Each success by pursuer eliminates one success from the target. If
   pursuer matches or exceeds target's successes, pursuer catches up; if target
   more than doubles pursuer's successes, target escapes.

## Feats of Strength

A character can automatically accomplish any feat of strength less than or equal
to their strength pool (ie. someone with 3 dots in strength can automatically
bust down a wooden door). For any feat beyond that, they may roll willpower
(diff 9) to boost their effective strength. Each success on the willpower roll
acts as a +1 to the pool (ie. someone with 3 dots in strength and 2 successes on
the willpower roll can smash open a metal fire door).

|Dice Pool   |Feat                               |Lift
|------------|-----------------------------------|------
|1           |Crush a soda can                   | 40 lbs
|2           |Break a chair                      | 100 lbs
|3           |Bust down a wooden door            | 250 lbs
|4           |Break a 2 x 4                      | 400 lbs
|5           |Smash open a metal fire door       | 650 lbs
|6           |Throw a motorcycle                 | 800 lbs
|7           |Flip a small car                   | 900 lbs
|8           |Snap a lead pipe                   | 1000 lbs
|9           |Punch through a cement wall        | 1200 lbs
|10          |Tear open a steel drum             | 1500 lbs
|11          |Punch through 1" of sheet metal    | 2000 lbs
|12          |Snap a streetlight post            | 3000 lbs
|13          |Throw a sedan                      | 4000 lbs
|14          |Toss an SUV                        | 5000 lbs
|15          |Hurl a pickup truck                | 6000 lbs

                               HEALTH AND INJURY

# Health
Most people and humanoid things have 7 'health levels'. When they get hurt they
get penalties to their dice pools and movement as outlined below.

|Health Levels  |Dice Pool Penalty* |Movement Penalty
|---------------|-------------------|---------
|0: Uninjured       |0             |-You're fine
|1: Bruised         |0             |-Minor pain and swelling; banged up but otherwise fine
|2: Hurt            |-1            |-Cuts, bruises, aches, perhaps bleeding but no major impairment
|3: Injured         |-1            |-Minor, painful injuries limit the character to half their normal movement
|4: Wounded         |-2            |-Notable injuries handicap him; the character can't run but may still walk
|5: Mauled          |-2            |-Significant internal and external damage; character can hobble around(3 yards per turn) but not move normally
|6: Crippled        |-5            |-Catastrophic injuries; character can only crawl (1 yard per turn)
|7: Incapacitated   |n/a           |-Character is unconscious from pain and trauma
|Dead                |n/a           |-U ded, ho

> *These dice pool penalties do not effect soak rolls

### Types of Injury
**Bashing Damage** - blunt impact, short falls, psychic attacks, fistfight injuries,
knockout gas, minor illness, most types of drugs and other pains the average
person might walk away from. It is possible but not likely to die from bashing.

Bashing can be soaked with sta. When bashing takes a character to Incapacitated,
all subsequent bashing damage is lethal, starting from the top of the health
chart.

**Lethal Damage** - harm dealt by guns, blades, long falls, sharp impacts, electrical
burns, puncture wounds, deadly poisons, fatal diseases, and other mortal
injuries. The average character cannot soak lethal damage.

Unlike bashing damage, lethal may cause a character's health to deteriorate
without medical care (int + medicine) to stabilize. 

At all levels below Hurt(2), untreated lethal wounds grow one level worse each
day. 

**Aggravated Damage** - fire, acid, virulent toxins, vampire fangs, radiation,
explosions, and similar physical atrocities.

Aggravated damage cannot be soaked by most physical beings. Some types of
protection (armor, magic, etc) can resist aggravated damage. Healing this damage
requires long term medical treatment or magic but in other regards is treated as
lethal damage. The character's health deteriorates like lethal and must be
stabilized to prevent further damage over time.

**Psychic Trauma** - mental attacks, torture, abominable tomes, emotional shocks and
other things that may cause psychosomatic pain. This is bashing damage but is
soaked by willpower rather than stamina. A character incapacitated by psychic
trauma may become mentally ill or gain a flaw that reflects their wounded mind.

## Healing Damage
Different kinds of damage take different amounts of time to heal. The times
listed below are cumulative, meaning if you have taken 3 health levels of
bashing damage, it would take you 1 hour to heal each level for a total of 3
hours before being fully healed.

### Bashing
|Health Level               | Recovery Time
|-|-
|Bruised to Hurt (1-3)      | 1 hour
|Wounded(4)                 | 1 hour*
|Mauled (5)                 | 3 hours*
|Crippled (6)               | 6 hours*
|Incapacitated (7)          | 12 hours*

### Lethal and Aggravated
|Health Level               | Recovery Time
|-|-
|Bruised (1)                |1 day
|Hurt (2)                   |3 days
|Injured (3)                |1 week*
|Wounded (4)                |1 month*
|Mauled (5)                 |2 months*
|Crippled (6)               |3 months*
|Incapacitated (7)          |5 months*



The recovery times listed on the chart assume an injured character has rest and
basic medical attention. Under especially good conditions (skilled physicians,
an uninterrupted healing space, etc.), the listed time may be one or even two
categories better than the ones given on the chart.

> *Medical treatment (help from a character with medicine 2 or better) is essential
for bashing injuries of Wounded (4) or worse and for lethal/aggravated injuries
or Injured(3) or worse. Without that treatment, the character suffers
more-or-less permanent impairment until healed by magic or extensive medical

## COMBAT

Combat takes place within the framework of the action turn. After Initiative is
determined, offensive, defensive, and other  actions are declared. Once actions are
declared, non-defensive actions occur and are rolled in initiative order*.

>*oWoD: Characters declare their actions lowest initiative to highest initiative, then
actions resolve highest to lowest

Defensive rolls are "saved" and are only rolled when the person is targeted with an appropriate attack. 

#### Declaration Phase
1. Initiative is determined 
1. Actions are declared
#### Resolution Phase
1. Non-defense rolls are performed in the order determined by initiative
1. Defense rolls are done as necessary
    1. Damage rolls are performed (and potentially soaked) when an attack succeeds
    1. Health levels are modified based on damage

### Attacks
All difficulties default to 6 but can vary based on circumstance
|Attack Type            | Die Pool
|-|-
|guns                   |dex + firearms
|thrown weapons         |dex + athletics
|hand-heald weapons     |dex + melee
|hand-to-hand           |dex + brawl or dex + martial arts
|magic                  |arete/enlightenment. If it requires a physical component (a punch, etc) roll the appropriate attack 

### Defense
|Defense Type           |Die Pool
|-|-
|dodge                  |dex + athletics or dex + acrobatics
|block                  |dex + brawl
|parry                  |dex + melee
|countermagick          |<++>

- You can declare a defensive maneuver at any point in your turn so long as you
have an action left to perform. In cases where you have declined to declare an
action, this is a free choice. If you have already declared a different action
for the turn, you may make a willpower roll (diff 6) or spend a willpower point
to change your character's mind. 

- You make attack and defend in the same turn following the dice pool rules for
multiple actions.

**Dodging:**
dex + athletics. The difficulty depends on the nature of the attack and the
distance the dodging character wants to cover during the dodge. Dodging a
hand-to-hand strike: diff 5. Dodging firearms at close range: diff 9 or
10. Each success subtracts one success from the attacker's roll. 

**Blocking:**
dex + brawl to use a body part to deflect a blow. Difficulty typically
ranges between 6 (for a fist) and 8 (for a table). Each success scored by
the defender removes a success from the attacker's attempt.

Normally, only hand-to-hand attacks can be blocked. A character with martial
arts can attempt to block spears, other thrown objects, or arrows with a dex +
martial arts roll (diff 8). Normal humans cannot block lethal or aggravated
damage attacks unless they are wearing armor,

**Parrying (and Rebound Attacks):**
A parry works the same as a block except you are using a weapon to block and
incoming attack.

If an attacker uses a brawl attack that gets defended by a parry (like a punch
deflected with a knife) then the attacker probably hurts themself. The defender
rolls a "rebound attack" if the successes rolled to parry the attack outnumber
the successes the opponent rolled when attacking them.

A rebound attack uses a typical dex + melee roll using the full dice pool. If
successful, it scores the usual amount of damage + one success for each success
that outnumbered the attackers roll. (A parry that scores two successes more
than necessary, for example, would add two more successes to that rebound
attack.) 

**"Desperate" or Full Defense:**
The character dedicates all of their efforts to defending themselves. They are
unable to do anything else in the turn. Roll the appropriate defensive roll
(dodge, block, etc) with your full dice pool against the first attack. Then
subtract one die from the pool for each subsequent attack that turn.

###  Damage

**Soaking:**
Roll the character's stamina against a difficulty determined by the type of
damage. Bashing can be soaked by any character (diff 6). Lethal can't be soaked
by normal humans (unless they are protected by some sort of armor) but may be
soaked by different creatures at 6 or higher diff. Aggravated cannot be soaked
by humans and most other creatures. Soaking it usually requires paranormal
protection or heavy-duty armor.

Each success on a soak roll reduces the damage taken by one health level. If the
soak eliminates all of the successes scored against a character, they've gotten
hit but not hurt.

**Calculating Damage:**
The most dangerous type goes on the top of the chart. Take Bob. Bob gets punched
in the face and takes 2 bashing damage after his soak.

|Health Level       | |
|-|-
|0: Uninjured      |[ / ]
|1: Bruised        |[ / ]
|2: Hurt           |[ &nbsp; ]
|3: Injured        |[ &nbsp; ]
|4: Wounded        |[ &nbsp; ]
|5: Mauled         |[ &nbsp; ]
|6: Crippled       |[ &nbsp; ]
|7: Incapacitated  |[ &nbsp; ]

Bob then gets stabbed with a pencil and takes a total of 1 lethal damage

|Health Level       | |
|-|-
|0: Uninjured      |[ X ]
|1: Bruised        |[ / ]
|2: Hurt           |[ / ]
|3: Injured        |[ &nbsp; ]
|4: Wounded        |[ &nbsp; ]
|5: Mauled         |[ &nbsp; ]
|6: Crippled       |[ &nbsp; ]
|7: Incapacitated  |[ &nbsp; ]

Then Bob gets lit on fire and takes 3 aggravated damage. Poor Bob.
|Health Level       | |
|-|-
|0: Uninjured      |[ * ]
|1: Bruised        |[ * ]
|2: Hurt           |[ * ]
|3: Injured        |[ X ]
|4: Wounded        |[ / ]
|5: Mauled         |[ / ]
|6: Crippled       |[ &nbsp; ]
|7: Incapacitated  |[ &nbsp; ]

### Combat Tactics and Circumstances

**Ambush:**
Attacker rolls dex + stealth vs target's per + alertness

If the attacker wins, they get one attack roll against the opponent before
initiate rolls are made. Add one die to the pool for each success beyond the
minimum. 

On a tie, attacker may act normally for a round while the defender can only make a defensive maneuver

If the defender wins, roll normal initiative.

**Armor and Shields:**
Armor adds to the wearer's soak pool and allows them to soak lethal damage, as
well as certain types of aggravated damage. Light armor is not encumbering but
heavier armor may inflict a penalty on the wearer's dex-based dice
pool. Different types of armor take differing amounts of time to put on.

Shields make the wearer harder to hit. An opponent facing your shield in
hand-to-hand or melee combat adds 1 or 2 to the difficulty to hit you, depending
on the size of the shield in question. When used to defend against projectiles,
the shield acts as armor, reducing  the number of successes from an attack by
one for every level in the shield's rating.

If a shield is being used to actively defend, it requires a dex + melee roll as
a dedicated blocking/parrying action.

**Blinded, Knocked Down, Immobilized, or Stunned:**
Blinding: blinded characters cannot dodge, parry, or block incoming
attacks. They also add 2 difficulty of all visually dependent actions until they
are able to see again

**Knockdown:** The character must take an action to get back up. If they can't
do so, they can be considered temporarily immobilized until they get back on
their feet.

**Immobilization:**
When a character gets held down, paralyzed, or otherwise rendered unable to
move, any other character who attacks him reduces their difficulty by 2 if the
target can still move around a bit, or can hit them automatically if the target
is fully immobilized

**Stunning:**
If **after the soak roll** a character suffers health-level damage that
exceeds their stamina rating, they're stunned until the end of the following
turn. The stunned character can't make any significant actions. Attack rolls
against them during that time reduce their difficulty by 2.
